title: "Clinical Subtyping of Multiple Sclerosis with SuStaIn"
excerpt: "Here, I led a project at Columbia Medical Center to generate informative clinical subtypes in a large dataset of patients with MS. In evaluating the clinical features available, I chose to apply a self-optimized version of SuStaIn (sub typing and staging inference) and identified 3 subtypes that differed in their disease progression as well as demographic and neurophysiological features.
