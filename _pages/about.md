I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Neuroinformatics Lab](https://www.neuroinformaticslab.com/) at NYU advised by [Dr. Erdem Varol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7GlElV0AAAAJ&hl=en) where I develop novel, efficient, and scalable methods to analyze neural and genomic data. 

My research is focused on uncovering the relationship between genetics and brain connectivity patterns, an avenue that can impact how we treat brain disorders. I approach this research problem by applying techniques from statistical machine learning, graph-theory, and deep learning to large genomic and neuroimaging datasets. My research is supported by the [NDSEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoD_NDSEG_Fellowship) fellowship.

More broadly, I’m curious about the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence and how we can improve AI systems to benefit human health.

**Research Interests:** computational neuroscience, machine learning, neuroimaging, genomics


Background
------
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive & Brain Sciences from Tufts University. At Tufts, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Tufts Human Computer Interaction Lab](https://tufts-hci-lab.github.io/) and the [Integrative Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://tuftsiconlab.weebly.com/). I also played on the Tufts men’s soccer team where I competed for four years and won two DIII National Championships.

After undergrad, I worked as a neuroimaging research technician and data analyst at Columbia University’s Department of Neurology and Biostatistics.

In my free time I enjoy biking, travelling, and supporting Arsenal FC.
