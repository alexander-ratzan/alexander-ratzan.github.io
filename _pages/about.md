I’m Alex, a first year PhD student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. As a School of Engineering fellow, I am working with [Dr. Erdem Varol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7GlElV0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Neuroinformatics Lab](https://www.neuroinformaticslab.com/) to develop novel, efficient, and scalable algorithms to solve problems in neuroscience. 

I am currently interested in translating complex neural and genetic data into lower dimensional representations. In a broader sense, I am interested in solving problems related to brain disorders through computational techniques. 

**Research Interests:** large-scale neuroimaging, machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry/neurology


Background
------
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive & Brain Sciences from Tufts University. At Tufts, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Tufts Human Computer Interaction Lab](https://tufts-hci-lab.github.io/) and the [Integrative Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://tuftsiconlab.weebly.com/). I also played on the men’s soccer team at Tufts where I competed for four years and won two DIII National Championships. 

After undergrad, I worked as a neuroimaging research technician and data analyst at Columbia University’s Department of Neurology and Biostatistics.

In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, biking, travelling, and supporting Arsenal FC.
